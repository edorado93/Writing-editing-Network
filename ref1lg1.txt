we propose a novel solution to the problem of training a model that is able to detect and segment unseen objects in a scene . we show how to train and simplify the training of a convolutional network to predict the activation function for a new task . we show that our model is able to generate hundreds of video frames that can be trained in an end-to-end image classification setting , where training data is either sparse or fixed ) when the task of object classification is limited . we demonstrate that our new method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the object detection task using unsupervised feature learning , and cnn-based methods for the task , thereby improving detection performance of our method .
