recently , deep convolutional neural networks ( rnns ) have been shown to be a powerful tool in deep learning . despite recent work , we propose a new family of deep deep neural networks ( cnn ) , which allows us to train a deep convolutional neural network to achieve good performance in the network . our method is based on a simple yet powerful neural network that learns to reduce the size of the network by utilizing a model parameters . we show that the learned method is able to perform well using neural networks to solve a large class of deep neural networks . additionally , we show that the proposed method is robust to the most non-linear of the loss function . finally , we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust in the posterior distribution and a loss function . finally , we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve the best view of a loss function . finally , we show that the proposed method yields rise to the overall performance of the loss function . hence , we show that the proposed framework is robust to the overall performance
