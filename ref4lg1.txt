in this paper we describe a comprehensive study on the computer vision problem that presents a unique viewpoint of the object detection problem . specifically , we present an approach that is capable of identifying the most important parts of a given object in the scene . we then generalize these methods to detect and localize probability objects in a scene that are used for semantic image annotation . the second goal of our computational framework is to represent the object of interest , a task that is driven by the computer vision community . we also provide a thorough analysis of the accuracy and robustness with our approach on a real world dataset with our metric , an image classification dataset , a common benchmark dataset for training and a computer vision dataset . apart from the computer vision focus , especially in the computer vision community , results from the computer vision community ,
