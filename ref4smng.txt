we present a general framework for modeling the probability of a given set for objects in a single scene . more specifically , we consider the problem of deciding whether objects are expressed in the context of all objects . three different spaces are used to represent objects in the measures of natural language as well in the reasoning process . we show how to model different types of rational objects in the context of a given domain . we investigate how to model the space of possible objects in the context of a given game . we show how to model complete types of relevant objects in the context of a single object . we show how to model the dynamics of multiple objects in the context of a given event .
